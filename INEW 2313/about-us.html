                I'm pursuing a certificate in Advanced Web Application Development at Dallas College to further my career as a Software Developer. Prior to enrolling at Dallas College, I worked in the Hospitality Industry. I have a bachelor's degree
                from the University of North Texas. At the start of the pandemic, I lost my job. I decided to pursue software development as a career by first teaching myself how to code. I enrolled in Dallas College to have a more structured learning.
                During my time in school, I landed my first job as a software developer. My coursework at Dallas college has helped me in my newfound career. I will complete my certificate in Summer 2023.

                In this course, I learned a lot more about bootstrap than I already knew. It's useful for adding structure to webpages without having to define everything myself. Creating the navigation in bootstrap was great.
                I love that it has a collapse class and that you can define when you want it to automatically expand to the full navigation instead of the hamburger icon with a class name. It saves a lot of work compared to the lesson prior where we had to write 
                javascript for the same functionality.I also enjoyed learning how to use vanilla Javascript in an HTML document. Previously, I had learned Javascript separate from HTML/CSS and never learned how to combine them. I then dove right into different 
                frameworks such as React and Angular, never learning the basic combination of Javascript and HTML. Going back to the basics is important and can help me solve problems that I could overcomplicate in the future. This class can help me in the future
                because I can better explain things I learned previously on my own now that I have a more in depth knowledge. Knowing how something works is important rather than just going through the motions.
