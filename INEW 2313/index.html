               <h1>Hi Y'all! I'm Michelle!</h1>
               <p>
                    Born and raised in Texas, I come from Fort Worth, attended UNT in Denton, and then moved to Dallas.
                    DFW is my home and I haven't known anything else. 
                    I received a bachelor's degree from the University of North Texas in Integrative Studies.
                    I worked for years in the Hospitality Industry until the pandemic hit.
                    When the world came to a stop, I realized my career had no work-life balance and I needed a change.
               </p>
               <p>
                    That's when I decided to make a career change and enter into the world of Software Development.
                    I started teaching myself how to code through free online programs such as Kahn Academy & Codecademy.
                    My first project was an html/css baby shower website for my sister's baby shower (it was virtual).
                    I created a portfolio website for myself and worked with a mentor on a side project.
                    I decided to enroll at Dallas College to continue my education in a more structured format.

               <h3>Courses taken at Dallas College</h3>
               <p>
                    I enrolled in a Advanced Web Applciation Development Certificate.
                    Since I already have an (unrelated) bachelor's degree, I didn't think I could afford to pursue another one, especially while unemployed from the pandemic.
                    In my time at Dallas College, I have taken Java and Advanced Java programming, Intermediate and Advanced Web Programming,
                    Database Programming, Web Design 1, and Linux Installation/Configuration. The web programming courses were a lot of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                    I'm currently taking Web Authoring, Programming Logic & Design, and a Comprehensive Software Project.
                    After this semester, I'm just missing a Mobile Applicaiton Development course and I will have completed my certificate!
               </p>
               <h3>Professional Goals</h3>
               <p>
                    My end goal is to be a talented <strong>Software Engineer/Developer</strong> doing work toward something I'm interested in.
                    In Summer 2022, I managed to land my first entry level software developer job at an Education Technology company.
                    I'm very grateful for my job and all the learning I'm able to do but I want to do more.
                    Hopefully after I complete my certificate, I can enroll in a Master's program for Computer Science.
                    There are a few online Master's programs that don't require my bachelor's to be in computer science.
                    However, they are very competitive to get into. I hope to do some side projects to build up my portfolio
                    so I can get into one of these programs. I have some ideas for projects but am not 100% sure how to execute them. 
                    The courses I'm currently taking will hopefully give me some insite into starting a project on my own.
               </p>
               <p>
                    If I'm able to enroll in a Master's program, I'm hoping I'll be able to further my knowledge to help me perform better at my current company.
                    I would like to one day be knowledgeable enough to mentor someone else who is new and starting out like I am now.
                    I eventually would like to move to a larger company where there is more opportunity or even maybe start a company of my own one day with what I learn.
               </p>
               <h3>Outside of school</h3>
               <p>
                    When I'm not working or doing assignments for school, I like to read.
                    I have a family book club where we meet virtually once a month. I'm more into fiction books, especially thrillers.
                    However, recently I've been giving non-fiction books a chance. I like listening to podcasts a lot.
                    My current favorite podcasts are "The Weirdest Thing I Learned This Week" and "Darknet Diaries". Both are informative podcasts told in captivating ways.
                    Outside of the house, I enjoy tennis, hiking, and soccer. Although, I'm not very good at soccer.
               </p>
               <p>
                    I'm also an <em>avid</em> show watcher. A good friend once said they only watch what me and my partner recommend.
                    I felt honored to hear that. Currently obsessing over <cite>The Last of Us</cite> but I haven't played the game.
                    I can't wait the 2 years before the next season of <cite>House of the Dragon</cite>. Looking forward to <cite>Succession</cite> and <cite>Tedd Lasso</cite>'s new seasons coming up.
                    I'll basically watch any show HBO puts out and it's starting to be that way with AppleTV too. If you want to talk TV, I'm available.
                 
               </p>
