      <p>My name is Michelle Phillips. I'm enrolled in INEW 2330 as a capstone course toward my Advanced Web Development Certificate.
          I decided to switch industries during the beginning of the pandemic and started teaching myself how to code.
          I started this certificate while I was teaching myself. I wanted a more structured learning to balance out what I was learning on my own.
          I managed to get my first software development job in Summer '22 but decided to continue working on the certificate.
          I hope to finish this an apply for Master Programs in Computer Science to expand my learning.
          I'm really looking forward to this class!
